        <h2><span style='font-size:50px;'>&#10024;</span>Description:</h2>
        <p>This is the PacMen exercise from week 7 of MIT EXPro. In this exercise I made a factory of PacMen who slowly bounce across the screen.</p>

        <p>Simply open the HTML file.</p>
        <h2><span style='font-size:50px;'>&#128679;</span>Roadmap to Future Improvements:</h2>
        <p>I would like to work a bit more on this and make the PacMen move back across the screen.</p>
